# About This Project
Project 0.2 is designed to replicate the web design of an existing webpage.  The goals of this project are the following:
- improve my knowledge of the box method.
- practice my attention to detail when styling.
- gain experience with some basic layout designs.

# Stepping Stone
This project will help me get ready to develope the layout for my own blog, which will likely be project 1.0.  After I develop my own blog design, I will have to learn javascript.  That way I will be able to integrate some code into my blog to allow it to function and interact with the user.
