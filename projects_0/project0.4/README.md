# Summary of Project

This project tested out the integration of PHP and MYSQL with HTML code by creating a rudimentary 
log-in page.  I learned how to incorporate the POST method with PHP code to scan and manipulate 
a database.

# Stepping Stone

Now that I have learned how to integrate MYSQL, PHP, Javascript, CSS, SASS, and HTML all together,
I am ready to construct dynamic webpages.
