# About This Project

Project 0.3 is designed to fine tune my skills in SASS styling, integrating javascript 
code with interactive elements of a webpage, and providing links to other webpages.  This
will hopefully finish the foundational knowledge needed to ensure that my blog will be 
interactive and fully equipped to optimize the user's experience.  

The goals of this project are:
- demonstrate my ability to code with SASS
- improve my organizational abilities of larger projects 
- demonstrate my ability to integrate javascript with jQuery into webpages 
- finalize the framework for a blog in project 1

# Stepping Stone

After this project, I will begin to implement the foundation for my own blog, which will be 
used to highlight my own work in a variety of fields.  I will attempt to publish this blog
for free via GitHub's free policy for 1 webpage.
