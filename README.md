## Summary
This series of projects demonstrates my work up to date in web development.  The goal of each project is to highlight a certain skill that I have practiced or acquired.  Each project is also a stepping stone towards the next project, which might build upon previous concepts, or move in a more complex direction. 

## Goals
Some goals of this work are the following:
- Demonstrate my mastery of web-design.
- Demonstrate my own progress in learning material quickly and independently.
- Develop my own blog, in which I can post interesting information and my own code projects in a user friendly manner.
- Acquire a better understanding of what it means to be a developer.
